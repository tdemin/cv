        \end{itemize}
    \item
        Managed both IDP-internal (fluent-bit / Loki / Prometheus / Thanos / Alertmanager
        / Grafana) and project-specific (Logstash, Elasticsearch / Prometheus / Grafana)
        monitoring and logging services. Maintained team-specific monitoring for Oracle XE
        and PostgreSQL.
    \item
        Administered corporate YouTrack instance, developed JavaScript workflows for teams using

    \item
        Combined DevOps and backend developer roles on one of the projects: worked on
        services providing cron webhooks and container image building capabilities in Go /
